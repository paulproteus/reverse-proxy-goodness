The purpose of this repo is to contain a script that will tell you if
a given website would serve out headers that would let a reverse proxy
(like CloudFlare) cache it.

The purpose of the cache is to make it so that if the site suddenly
finds itself under heavy load to a small number of pages, CloudFlare
handles most of that load.
